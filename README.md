# Shilingi

*Shilingi is a swahili word for the Kenyan Currency*

Shilingi is an app bundle to allow me to track my expenditure. The following are the questions that I'd like the
app to help me answer:

1. How much did I spend on month X?
2. What are the specific things I spent my money on a specific month X?
3. How much money went to a specific item Y on a particular month X?
4. How long did it take me to exhaust an item Y of a specific quantity Z and unit A?

The above questions are the starting point to this project. This will definitely be added to and revised as is necessary.
